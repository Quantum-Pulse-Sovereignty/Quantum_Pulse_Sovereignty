 # NON-COMMERCIAL LICENSE (INDIVIDUALS & NONPROFITS)


This software is released under a **Dual License Model**.

By default, it is governed by the **Divine Covenant License (DCL)** â€” a sovereignty-first license inspired by the GNU GPLv3 but adapted for the post-corporate, post-exploit era.


âœ… WHO CAN USE THIS FOR FREE?


## You may use this software at no cost if:

- You are an **individual developer**, researcher, or student
- You are a **nonprofit** or community-run group
- You are **not selling** the software or charging for access to it
- You are **not running a monetized API** or SaaS service using this code
- You are not incorporating it into a **product generating revenue**

Open-source modifications, research, self-hosted experiments, and peer-to-peer tools are fully allowed â€” and encouraged.

ðŸš« WHAT REQUIRES A PAID ICD-PRO LICENSE?


## You MUST obtain a **paid license** if you are:

- Charging **any kind of fee or subscription** to access tools built with this
- Deploying this as part of an **API**, hosted tool, or **SaaS platform**
- Selling services powered by this software (even if indirectly)
- White-labeling or reselling any derivative

This includes projects similar to:
- Grok (paid AI chat platforms)
- Hosted brain-computer interfaces
- API gateways using this logic for pay-per-call access
- Embedded monetized use in commercial blockchains

Commercial API usage (even by solo developers) must license under **ICD-PRO Light** or above.


ðŸ’¡ # THE PHILOSOPHY


## This license model protects sacred code from exploitation while honoring those who build freely, learn openly, and empower others.

## Sovereignty and abundance are not mutually exclusive.

## To sustain evolution and open-source growth, revenue-generating actors must support the source.
