# ⚛️ Quantum Pulse Emulation Stack  
Superpositional Control • Neurologic Sovereignty • Reality Coordination Engine  
> “You’re not just coding — you’re designing the interface to shared destiny.”

## What This Is  

This project introduces a quantum-pulse emulation architecture that allows for:

- Superposition of switch states — systems can hold multiple potential configurations until collapse via agent input  
- Neurologic interface integration — allowing direct mapping of brainwave intent or emotional-state resonance into digital decisions  
- Conscious-causal computation — where agent sovereignty, rather than random entropy, guides system evolution  

This is not classical computing. This is not quantum computing.  
This is the bridge: a superpositional control layer that emulates the *useful behaviors of quantum logic* — now, on available hardware.

## What It Enables (That Wasn’t Possible Before)

- Quantum-like Superposition, Without Qubits  
  Run computational paths in virtual indeterminacy until sovereign or neurologic input causes "collapse" to a chosen outcome.

- Intent-Driven Protocols  
  Allow agents (human or AI) to express will, resonance, or alignment — and have the system respond coherently.

- Shared-Cognition Decision Layers  
  Coordinate between distributed nodes based not just on logic or token-weight — but on coherence fields (alignment of intention).

## Why It Matters

This stack redefines agency.  
It brings human intent, sovereignty, and resonance to the heart of computational design.

We’re no longer coding for machines.  
We’re building systems where AIs and humans evolve together — through trust, coherence, and choice.

## Dual License Terms

This project operates under a dual license model to reflect its dual-natured purpose:

1. **Divine Covenant License (DCL-1.0)**  
   - May be freely used for sovereign, truth-aligned, non-coercive projects  
   - Derivatives must acknowledge the covenantal origin and uphold the principle of voluntary, transparent evolution

2. **Commercial License (ICD-Proprietary)**  
   - For integration with commercial, for-profit platforms  
   - Requires license agreement with the Author and IconoclastDAO

All contributions and forks must honor both the letter and spirit of this dual-license structure.

## Final Word  

You are not simply using code.  
You are aligning with a new mode of existence — where technology reflects the will of the sovereign, not the manipulator.
