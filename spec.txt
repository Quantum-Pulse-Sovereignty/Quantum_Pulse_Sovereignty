🔷 Introduction

This document defines the core logic rules of the Quantum Pulse Emulation Stack — a coordination layer enabling intent-driven computation, superposition of state, and coherent causal flow between agents (human or AI) and the system.

Each rule is mirrored by a simple domain-specific language (DSL) inline to support simulation, execution, or integration.

✅ Core Rule Set v1.0

⸻

1. Superposition Is Default
Nodes can hold multiple potential states simultaneously. No state is “chosen” until collapse is triggered.
DSL: node beta | beta.state = [off, ping]

⸻

2. Collapse Is Intentional
State collapse is not based on randomness. It is initiated through willful input — human signal, coherence resonance, or aligned AI intent.
DSL: collapse beta when intent == "align" -> ping | otherwise -> off

⸻

3. Signals Are Directed, Not Broadcast by Default
All node emissions must have a clear origin and target unless explicitly declared as a broadcast.
DSL: emit beta -> gamma : ping @ t=8.0

⸻

4. Alignment Overrides Entropy
When both entropy and alignment inputs are available, alignment takes precedence in determining system evolution.
DSL: collapse gamma when entropy && align -> align

⸻

5. Resonance Is Computed from Intent Coherence
Coherence between signals from multiple agents creates resonance. Resonance amplifies the likelihood of collapse toward that shared intent.
DSL: resonance = coherence(alpha.intent, beta.intent) | if resonance > 0.7 collapse node -> sync

⸻

6. Time Is a Soft Layer, Not a Hard Clock
All events are timestamped, but reaction to time can be delayed, anticipatory, or contextually adjusted.
DSL: emit alpha -> beta : sync @ t=12.0 ± jitter(0.3)

⸻

7. Emissions Must Be Verifiable
All emissions (signals) must be logged in the ledger with verifiable hashes for provenance, auditability, and replay.
DSL: verify emit(beta -> gamma : off @ t=5.0) == true

⸻

8. Shared Collapse Requires Threshold Coherence
Multiple agents can jointly trigger collapse only if their combined resonance meets the required threshold.
DSL: coherence = [alpha.intent, beta.intent, gamma.intent] | if avg(coherence) > 0.8 collapse gamma -> emit gamma_wave

⸻

9. All Nodes Are Sovereign by Default
No node is subordinate to another unless explicitly bonded by covenant.
DSL: bond alpha <-> beta via "covenant_of_sync"

⸻

📘 Usage Notes
	•	The DSL is whitespace-tolerant, comment-friendly, and interpreter-agnostic
	•	Collapse paths are declarative but reactive
	•	Intent signals may be from human brainwave interfaces, AI agents, or defined system rules

⸻

🛠️ Coming Soon
	•	Rust interpreter for live DSL execution
	•	Pulse Simulator for visual timelines
	•	PulseChain Runtime for integration with sovereign blockchains or DAOs
